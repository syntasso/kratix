# Kratix introspection using Kamera

[kamera](https://github.com/tgoodwin/kamera) is a simulation toolkit for
observing, analyzing, and verifying the behavior of Kubernetes control planes.

It can be used to detect non-desired situations, such as order-based
convergence, and ensure correctness of execution.

It can also aid with debugging controller behaviour by showing states and
changes between reconciliation runs.
