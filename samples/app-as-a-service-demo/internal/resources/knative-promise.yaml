Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently a rule value can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent . 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. If multiple matching Hosts were provided, the first rule will take precedent.'
