                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after
                                  the processes running in the pod are sent a termination

                                  than the expected cleanup time for your process.

                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after

              about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout
              policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator
              of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
              orchestrates ReplicaSets), and its usage is optional but recommended.
              \n The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
              and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own. \n See
